## Spaces instead tabs
If you often use github to review the code for open Pull Requests, maybe you already have noticed a problem in use tabs instead spaces.
While in your editor you define some amount of spaces for each tab you use, in other tools the result may be significantly different once that tool not necessarily use the same amount of spaces to represent a tab.
So, suddenly, two spaces may become four and some ugliness is inevitably shown to you. See below:

To avoid that, just define indentation as spaces in your preferred text editor or IDE.
