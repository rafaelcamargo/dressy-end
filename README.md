# Dressy End
When working in a team, define some patterns could be a great idea if contributors want to keep things organized and, consequently, easy and fast to mantain. Dressy End is a compilation of the best pratices and advices I have learned since I have started work as a front end developer.

### Contents
The content of this guide is divided into three well known areas at front end development plus the Environment topic. Environment is the place to share good advices in the use of task automators, dependecy managers or simply IDEs or text editors:
- [Markup](markup/README.md)
- [Style](style/README.md)
- [Script](script/README.md)
- [Environment](environment/README.md)

### Contribute
If you know some good pattern or advice which could be here, feel free to contribute.
I hope this guide can be useful for you as it has been to me.
